## MiraQL

MiraQL is an Electron based desktop app designed to assist programmers by rendering graphical representations of GraphQL queries and schemas, and providing a space for performance and speed metrics monitoring.

MiraQL is currently in beta. Please feel free to post any issues to our GitHub. We welcome any and all feedback!

## Getting Started
**Feature 1: GraphQL Playground**
Once your app opens, users can submit API endpoints in the form of URLs and test their queries and responses. Write and submit queries in the input field to receive responses or errors, and view them in the response and errors tabs.

**Feature 2: Easy Error Visualization**
If your response returns any errors, head to the errors tab to view them in an intuitive manner. View the status, status code, error type, and error message in an easy to read table.

**Feature 3: Schema Visualization**
Users can add in tables for a graphical representation of all the schema’s fields and relationships that they can then refer to while writing or editing queries.

**Feature 4: Response Metrics Analysis**
Go to the metrics tab to view data visualizations of query response speeds. Compare the speed of your most recent query to those of all previous query requests made with MiraQL in a line graph that updates every time you submit a query.
